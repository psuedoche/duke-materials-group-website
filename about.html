                <p class = "content-text">
                    The Curtarolo group is a computational materials science group in the Department Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and the Center for Autonomous Materials Design at Duke University. Our <a target = "_blank" href = "research_html">research</a> focuses on the autonomous discovery of new materials with desired properties, the development of synthesizability descriptors, and the description of disordered systems. To achieve our goal, we develop and employ the <a target = "_blank" href = "aflow.html">AFLOW</a> software suite. The generated data is publicly available in the <a target = "_blank" href = "http://aflow.org/">AFLOW database,</a>the largest of its kind with over 3.5 million entries. Our work is regularly<a target = "_blank" href = "publications.html">published</a>in high-quality, peer-reviewed journals.
                </p>
                <p class = "content-text">
                    Our group is organized in the<a target = "_blank" href = "http://aflow.org/consortium/">AFLOW Consortium</a>and is sponsored by the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> and the<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.arl.army.mil/business/muri/">Multi University Research Initiative (MURI)</a>of the United States Department of Defense.

                <h1 class = "subtitle">Our Outreach Activities</h1>
                <p class = "content-text">
                    We believe that research should be transparent and accessible to everyone. This is not only reflected in the open source nature of our software and the availability of our data, but also in our outreach activities. We regularly host AFLOW Schools to teach the use of the AFLOW software, our main research tool. Workshop videos and slides are publicly available on the <a target = "_blank" href = "http://aflow.org/aflow-school/">AFLOW website</a>.
                </p>
                <p class = "content-text">
                    In an effort to make high-quality research accessible to everyone, we launched a<a target = "_blank" href = " http://aflow.org/seminars/">virtual seminar series</a>with speakers covering a diverse range of topics in computational and experimental materials science. Participation is open to everyone and free of charge.
                </p>

                <p class = "content-text">
                    The Center for Autonomous Materials Design and Duke University aspire to create a community built on collaboration, innovation, creativity, and belonging. Our collective success depends on the robust exchange of ideas &mdash; an exchange that is best when a rich diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences flourishes. To achieve this exchange, it is essential that all members of the community feel secure and welcome, that the contributions of all individuals are respected, and that all voices are heard. All members of our community have a responsibility to uphold these values.
