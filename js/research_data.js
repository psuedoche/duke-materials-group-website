        content: "<a target = '_blank' href = 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41578-019-0170-8'>High-entropy ceramics</a> are an emerging research field of materials that combine the stabilizing effects of high configurational entropy with metal-nonmetal bonding, offering promising candidates for a variety of applications ranging from hypersonics to batteries. Due to the limits of density functional theory, modeling the prominent chemical disorder in these systems is a great challenge. Our group has developed the <a target = '_blank' href = 'https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b01449'>Partial OCCupation (POCC)</a> algorithm to describe disordered materials using a series of small supercells and thermodynamic averaging. The approach has been used to develop <a target = '_blank' href = 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07160-7'>entropy descriptors</a>, such as the entropy-forming ability (EFA), that reliably predict the synthesizability of high-entropy materials. This approach led to the discovery of new <a target = '_blank' href = 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07160-7'>high-entropy carbides</a>, and can greatly accelerate the discovery of new disordered materials when coupled with <a target = '_blank' href = 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-0317-6'>machine learning</a>. Our current research focuses on the prediction of new high-entropy ceramics and their physical properties using the POCC approach.",

While most metals can be transformed into a glassy state from a melt when cooled quickly, generating them as a bulk material is challenging. The vast phase space creates challenges for experimental exploration, necessitating complementary <i>in silico</i> contributions to prioritize promising materials.<br><br> Our approach to predicting the Glass Forming Ability (GFA) is based on quantifying the competition of initially formed crystal nuclei in the rapidly cooled material. Our group first introduced a <a target = '_blank' href = 'https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12315'>spectral descriptor for GFA</a>  for binary alloys.

Local atomic environments form the basis for these structural comparisons.

Drawing from the AFLOW material database, the GFA of new systems can be calculated efficiently, helping to prioritize the most promising material combinations.",
